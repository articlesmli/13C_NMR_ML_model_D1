### Using machine learning and 13C NMR spectroscopy data derived by SMILES to predict the influence of nanoformulations on biomolecule functionality. Demonstrative case: Human Dopamine D1 Receptor Antagonists.
- From folder named input run the lists_generatio.ipynb file and you will obtain files smiles.csv and targets.csv. Provided csv file in the current folders are regarding human dopamine D1 receptor antagonists.
- Creats an empty folder named output. The files in the curent folder output are a part of the D1receptor antagonsts scraped 13CNMR data which has been alredy scraped.
- Run files consicunetlly as they are numerated. 
- The last file 7.CID_SID_ML_model_D1.ijynb file is an additional ML modle with human dopamine D1 receptor antagonists data.
