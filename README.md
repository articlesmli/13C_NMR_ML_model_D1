### Using machine learning and 13C NMR spectroscopy data derived by SMILES to predict the influence of nanoformulations on biomolecule functionality. Demonstrative case: Human Dopamine D1 Receptor Antagonists.
- Run the fimr lists_generatio.ipynb from folder input and you will obtain files smiles.csv and targets.csv. Provided csv file in the current folders are regarding human dopamine D1 receptor antagonists
- Creat an empty folder named output. The files in the curent folder output are a part of the D1receptor antagonsts scraped 13CNMR data. 
- Run files consicunetlly as they are numerated.
